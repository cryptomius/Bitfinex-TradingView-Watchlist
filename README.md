## Bitfinex TradingView Watchlist

The two javascript snippets above extracts all tradeable pairs on Bitfinex. You can then import this as a watchlist into TradingView.com.

Setup:

Decide whether you want exchange or margin tradeable pairs and copy the appropriate javascript snippet.

1. The code needs to be converted into a bookmarklet so you can access it from your browser bookmarks. 
Go to [mrcoles.com/bookmarklet](https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/), paste the code where it says ‘Enter your javascript code here:’, click ‘Convert to bookmarklet’. Copy the code from where it says ‘and here is the code:’.
2. Go to your web browser Bookmark Manager and add a new bookmark. Paste the code you just copied into the ‘URL’ field, and name the bookmark (I’ve called it 'Bitfinex TV Watchlist’). I’d recommend placing the bookmark on your ‘Bookmarks Bar’ for easy access.

To use:

1. Log in to your [bitfinex.com](https://www.bitfinex.com) account.
2. Click the bookmark you’ve just created.
3. A text file will automatically be generated and downloaded for you to import into TradingView.com (Import Watchlist…)
